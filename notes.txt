Questions:

updateBoards
CreateBoard, sends data
api sends data, id and data object
server-side update function not receiving body values, sends {}

also check the repetition of _fetchBoards for create and update


change the delete boards function to also delete all bookmarks
associated with that board

when creating a board, the form stays open with the previously-created
board's info and when submitted it creates a new board again

same for bookmarks for some reason

hitting enter to create a board or bookmark doesnt work

there is no page for bookmarks, so how to get the id?
do it on the modify modal?

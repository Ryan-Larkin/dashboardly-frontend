Questions:

updateBoards
CreateBoard, sends data
api sends data, id and data object
server-side update function not receiving body values, sends {}, why?

also check the repetition of _fetchBoards for create and update
reusing the fetchboards function but could maybe do this more efficiently
pass as prop somewhere? * FIXED, MAYBE
  ^ ask if there will be any conflicts between boardcard and home
  pass fetchboards as prop from home to boardcard, then pass that prop
  again for the update, should work?


same for bookmarks for some reason => pass prop

there is no page for bookmarks, so how to get the id?
do it on the modify modal?

click outside the modal to close it? close after creating?


fixed:
delete boards and it will update properly

rocket bot
init ai
api ai
